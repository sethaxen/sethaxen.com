## About Me

I'm a data scientist, statistical programmer, and machine learning software engineer.

I passionately advocate for open source software and contribute to many open source projects, especially in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), including:
- [ArviZ](https://www.arviz.org): exploratory analysis of statistical models
- [Manifolds.jl](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl): algorithms and statistics on manifolds
- [ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl): generic automatic differentiation rules
- [e3fp](https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp): 3D molecular fingerprinting

Check out some of my [projects](./projects) or [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ql1INXcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), or follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sethaxen/), [Mastodon](https://bayes.club/@sethaxen), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sethaxen/).
