## About Me

I'm a scientist, probabilistic programmer, and research software engineer.

I passionately advocate for open source software and contribute to many open source projects, especially in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), including:
- [ArviZ](https://www.arviz.org): exploratory analysis of statistical models
- [Manifolds.jl](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl): algorithms and statistics on manifolds
- [ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl): generic automatic differentiation rules
- [e3fp](https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp): 3D molecular fingerprinting
