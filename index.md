## About

I'm a research scientist, statistician, and software engineer.
My passion is developing computational methods for faster and more reliable data analyses.
My PhD research focused on:
- [inferring protein structural ensembles](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6s62d8pw)
- [representing small molecules](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00696) for machine learning.

I am a passionate advocate for open source software, and contribute to many open source projects, in particular in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), including:
- [ArviZ.jl](https://github.com/arviz-devs/ArviZ.jl): exploratory analysis of statistical models
- [Manifolds.jl](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl): algorithms and statistics on manifolds
- [ChainRules.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl): generic automatic differentiation rules
- [e3fp](https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp): 3D molecular fingerprinting
Most of my contributions are to packages written in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/).
