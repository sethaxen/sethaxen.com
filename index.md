Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in the [Integrative Program in Quantitative Biology](http://ipqb.ucsf.edu/) (iPQB) and a member of the [Sali Lab](https://salilab.org/) at the [University of California, San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF).
Before that, I was a systems analyst in the [Kerfeld Lab](http://www.kerfeldlab.org/) at the [DOE Joint Genome Institute](http://jgi.doe.gov/).

My research interests span the broad, growing field of computational biology: the leveraging of computer science and mathematics/statistics in order to solve biological problems.
I am currently developing computational approaches to
1) determine conformations of proteins in a probabilistic, data driven fashion and
2) use 3D similarity of small molecules to predict binding to protein targets, in collaboration with the [Keiser lab](http://www.keiserlab.org/).
